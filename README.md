UNTESTED UNTESTED! (known errate at bottom:)

This is the project files for the schematic and PCB layout in KiCad for the Roland TB303 VCF for 12v modular system. Schematic via Eddy Bergman:

Thanks Eddy!

This project is my effort to add something back to the synth DIY community, and make use of pcb fabrication services.

It is for building a Voltage Controller Filter based on the Roland TB303 for -12/+12 modular systems.

Gerber zip is located in the "production" folder.

PLEASE NOTE: Currently this copy of the schematic and PCB is untested. Use at your own risk! (version 0.02 30/2/25)

KNOWN ERRATA:
 - C10, C11, C12, C13 (caps in the diode ladder between the transistors are labeled "uF", but they should be labelled "nF".
